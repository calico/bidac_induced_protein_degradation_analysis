This repository contains accompanying analysis code for the paper titled "Morphological and genetic screens reveal
mechanisms of BiDAC-induced plasma membrane protein degradation".

The included file `morphological_and_genetic_screens_reveal__paper_code.ipynb` is intended to be ran using Google Colab. In order to run the code:

1) Create a new Colab notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/
2) Go to `File > Upload notebook` and upload the .ipynb file included with this submission.
3) Follow instructions in the notebook to run the code.

We have also included data files containing embeddings generated by our models that are in the `embeddings/` subdirectory. These can be uploaded interactively to the Colab as specified in the Colab notebook itself.
